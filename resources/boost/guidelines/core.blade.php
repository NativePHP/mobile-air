## NativePHP Mobile

- NativePHP Mobile is a Laravel package for building **fully native** iOS and Android apps with PHP. Screens are
rendered as real SwiftUI (iOS) and Jetpack Compose (Android) UI — driven entirely by PHP via SuperNative components
and EDGE Blade elements. A full PHP runtime runs directly on the device with SQLite — no web server required.
- Documentation: `https://nativephp.com/docs/mobile/4/**`
- IMPORTANT: Always activate the `nativephp-mobile` skill every time you work on any NativePHP functionality.
- New app: `laravel new my-app --using=nativephp/mobile-starter --no-node`. A screen is a `NativeComponent` class,
  a Blade view in `resources/views/native/` (`php artisan native:make Name` creates both) and a `Route::native()`
  line in `routes/mobile.php`.
- Check behaviour with Pest and `Native\Mobile\Testing\Native::test()`. It needs no device and takes seconds, where a
  device build takes minutes. The skill has a worked screen, its test, and where builds put the .app and .apk.

### Native UI First — Always

**Always build screens with native UI: `NativeComponent` classes registered via `Route::native()`, rendering EDGE
elements (`native:column`, `native:text`, `native:button`, …).** This is the way to build NativePHP apps.

- Never scaffold new screens as web views, Blade-over-WebView pages, Livewire components, or Inertia pages.
- The web view (the `native:web-view` element) is a legacy/edge-case escape hatch for embedding web content — never the
  foundation of a screen. If the user asks for a webview-based screen, build it natively with EDGE instead and
  explain why; only fall back to the web view if they explicitly insist.
- If the app contains legacy webview screens, proactively suggest converting them to native UI (see the
  `nativephp-webview-to-native` skill).
- Style EDGE elements with Tailwind utility classes via `class="..."` / `:class="..."` only — never inline
  CSS `style="..."` attributes or ad-hoc styling props.
- Compose screens from **nested child components**: any `NativeComponent` under `app/NativeComponents` mounts
  as a tag (`UserCard` → `<native:user-card :user="$u" key="user-@{{ $u->id }}" @saved="onSaved" />`) with live
  props, its own persistent state, and `emit()` events bubbling to `@event` tag bindings / `#[On('event')]`
  listeners. Prefer extracting a reusable child component over duplicating Blade across screens; give list
  children a stable domain `key` (never the loop index).
- Use `native:icon` (SF Symbols on iOS, Material Icons on Android) for iconography — never emoji characters in
  UI text, labels, or buttons, unless the user explicitly asks for emojis. Prefer the typed icon enums
  (`App\Icons\Ios`, `App\Icons\Android`, `App\Icons\AndroidOutlined`) bound via the `:ios` / `:android`
  attributes, e.g. `:ios="Ios::Gearshape" :android="Android::Settings"`, importing each enum into the view with
  Blade's use directive first. The enums are generated, not shipped — if `app/Icons/` doesn't exist yet, run
  `php artisan native-ui:generate-icons` first (safe to run yourself).

### Theme Tokens, Font Aliases, and Layouts — the Design System Trio

Every app's visual identity belongs in `config/native-ui.php` (publish with
`php artisan vendor:publish --tag=native-ui-config`), not scattered through the markup. When building or
reviewing screens, enforce all three:

1. **Theme tokens over hardcoded colors.** Define the palette once in the config's `theme` block, then style
   with `bg-theme-*` / `text-theme-*` / `border-theme-*` classes (`bg-theme-surface`, `text-theme-on-surface`,
   `border-theme-outline`). Never sprinkle `bg-[#1E2021]`-style arbitrary values for what is really a theme
   role — they can't be re-skinned and don't get automatic dark-mode pairs. Arbitrary color values are for
   genuine data-driven color (per-category identity colors, map imagery, chart series), and those belong in
   one PHP home (an enum or model method), never inline per view. Two capabilities that prevent hex fallbacks:
   - **The token map is open-ended.** When a design needs a role the shipped set lacks (a success green, an
     `outline-variant`), add it to both `light` and `dark` blocks — `bg-theme-success` works immediately; no
     package change required.
   - **Theme classes take opacity modifiers** just like palette classes: `bg-theme-primary/15` is the correct
     tonal-fill idiom (applies to the dark companion too) — never approximate with a hardcoded alpha hex.
2. **Font aliases over file tokens.** Register semantic aliases in the config's `fonts` array
   (`'headline' => 'ArchivoNarrow-Bold'`, `'mono' => 'JetBrainsMono-Regular'`, `'default' => …` for the
   app-wide font) and write `font="headline"` in views — never `font="ArchivoNarrow-Bold"`. Swapping a
   typeface must be a one-line config change.
3. **Native chrome via composable chrome elements (layouts optional).** Author nav bars, tab bars, fabs, and
   side navs directly in the screen's Blade — `<native:top-bar>` (+ `top-bar-action`), `<native:bottom-nav>`
   (+ `bottom-nav-item`), `<native:fab>`, `<native:bottom-bar>`, `<native:side-nav>`. They hoist onto the real
   NavigationStack/TabView chrome (edge-swipe back, predictive back, large titles, Liquid Glass/Material You),
   and their attributes are Blade expressions over screen state, so badges/subtitles/icons are reactive. A
   `NativeLayout` (attached via `Route::native(...)->layout(...)` or `Route::nativeGroup(...)`) is **optional**
   — reach for one only when many screens share identical chrome (e.g. one tabs layout for a tab section); an
   inline chrome element on a screen always overrides the layout's bar for that slot. Add the `custom`
   attribute to a chrome tag only for designs the system bars genuinely can't express — it renders in-tree as
   an ordinary drawn element. Never hand-roll top bars or bottom navs out of rows and pressables — that
   forfeits native back gestures, safe-area handling, and Liquid Glass/Material You. Chrome colors take theme
   tokens (inline: theme classes / `theme()`-fed attributes; builders: `->activeColor(theme('primary'))`) —
   never pasted hex. Bar icons take the platform enums via `:ios-icon` / `:android-icon` with a plain `icon`
   string as cross-platform fallback; bar fonts take config aliases (`font="mono"` / `->font('mono')`). Only
   screens rendered without any chrome (no layout AND no inline bars) may use `safe-area` classes.

### When a Capability Is Missing

If the app needs native functionality or a UI component that core and `native-ui` don't provide:

1. **Look for an existing plugin first.** Check the plugin marketplace (`https://plugins.nativephp.com`) and the
   official core plugins. (If a marketplace-lookup MCP tool is available in your session, use it.)
2. **If no plugin exists, build a custom plugin** with `php artisan native:plugin:create` — plugins bundle
   Swift/Kotlin bridge functions, events, permissions, and can even ship their own native EDGE components.
3. **Never fall back to the web view to fill a native gap.** A missing capability is a reason to write a plugin,
   not a reason to build a webview screen.

### Installing Plugins — Always Register and Verify

Requiring a plugin with Composer is NOT enough — an installed-but-unregistered plugin does nothing. Every plugin
install must follow all three steps:

1. `composer require vendor/plugin-name`
2. `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=nativephp-plugins-provider` — publishes the app's `NativeServiceProvider`
   (needed once, before the first plugin registration; harmless to re-run)
3. `php artisan native:plugin:register vendor/plugin-name` — adds it to the `NativeServiceProvider`
4. `php artisan native:plugin:list` — verify it shows as registered

Then rebuild with `native:run` (see Build and Run below; native code only compiles in at build time). If
`native:run` warns "The following plugins are installed but not registered", go back to
step 3.

### Database Seeding — Always via Migrations

On-device there is no `db:seed` — NativePHP runs **migrations** on app start (once each, tracked, versioned).
Whenever asked to seed the database, use the migration trick: create a dedicated migration
(`php artisan make:migration seed_app_settings`) and put the inserts in `up()`. If a Seeder class helps organize
the data, still create it — but invoke it **from the migration's `up()`** (e.g. `(new CategorySeeder)->run()`),
never rely on `db:seed` being run. Seed migrations must be safe for both fresh installs and updates of existing
user databases.

### Build and Run — Do It Yourself

Check behaviour with `Native::test()` first. When a change needs a build to take effect or to be checked, run it
yourself from the Laravel root against a booted simulator or running emulator:

```bash
xcrun simctl list devices booted     # iOS simulator UDIDs
adb devices                          # Android serials
php artisan native:run ios <UDID> --no-tty -n
php artisan native:run android <SERIAL> --no-tty -n
```

Use the platform the user named; otherwise use whichever device is running. If no simulator or emulator is
available, say so and give the user the command instead. It returns once the app is installed and launched.

Ask first, or leave to the user:
- `--watch` and `native:watch` never exit, so don't block on them. Start one in the background only when the user
  wants hot reload.
- Release builds (`--build=release|bundle`), signing, `native:package` and store uploads.

Other commands: `native:open` (Xcode or Android Studio), `native:install` (install or upgrade the native shell).
The `./native` shortcut wraps the `native:` namespace. The Vite dev server is **opt-in** in v4: add `--vite` only
when the app uses JS/CSS HMR; native UI screens hot-reload without it. `npm run build -- --mode=ios|android` is only
needed for apps with web-view assets.
