## NativePHP Mobile

- NativePHP Mobile is a Laravel package for building **fully native** iOS and Android apps with PHP. Screens are
rendered as real SwiftUI (iOS) and Jetpack Compose (Android) UI — driven entirely by PHP via SuperNative components
and EDGE Blade elements. A full PHP runtime runs directly on the device with SQLite — no web server required.
- Documentation: `https://nativephp.com/docs/mobile/4/**`
- IMPORTANT: Always activate the `nativephp-mobile` skill every time you work on any NativePHP functionality.

### Native UI First — Always

**Always build screens with native UI: `NativeComponent` classes registered via `Route::native()`, rendering EDGE
elements (`native:column`, `native:text`, `native:button`, …).** This is the way to build NativePHP apps.

- Never scaffold new screens as web views, Blade-over-WebView pages, Livewire components, or Inertia pages.
- The web view (the `native:web-view` element) is a legacy/edge-case escape hatch for embedding web content — never the
  foundation of a screen. If the user asks for a webview-based screen, build it natively with EDGE instead and
  explain why; only fall back to the web view if they explicitly insist.
- If the app contains legacy webview screens, proactively suggest converting them to native UI (see the
  `nativephp-webview-to-native` skill).
- Style EDGE elements with Tailwind utility classes via `class="..."` / `:class="..."` only — never inline
  CSS `style="..."` attributes or ad-hoc styling props.
- Use `native:icon` (SF Symbols on iOS, Material Icons on Android) for iconography — never emoji characters in
  UI text, labels, or buttons, unless the user explicitly asks for emojis. Prefer the typed icon enums
  (`App\Icons\Ios`, `App\Icons\Android`, `App\Icons\AndroidOutlined`) bound via the `:ios` / `:android`
  attributes, e.g. `:ios="Ios::Gearshape" :android="Android::Settings"`, importing each enum into the view with
  Blade's use directive first. The enums are generated, not shipped — if `app/Icons/` doesn't exist yet, run
  `php artisan native-ui:generate-icons` first (safe to run yourself).

### When a Capability Is Missing

If the app needs native functionality or a UI component that core and `native-ui` don't provide:

1. **Look for an existing plugin first.** Check the plugin marketplace (`https://plugins.nativephp.com`) and the
   official core plugins. (If a marketplace-lookup MCP tool is available in your session, use it.)
2. **If no plugin exists, build a custom plugin** with `php artisan native:plugin:create` — plugins bundle
   Swift/Kotlin bridge functions, events, permissions, and can even ship their own native EDGE components.
3. **Never fall back to the web view to fill a native gap.** A missing capability is a reason to write a plugin,
   not a reason to build a webview screen.

### Installing Plugins — Always Register and Verify

Requiring a plugin with Composer is NOT enough — an installed-but-unregistered plugin does nothing. Every plugin
install must follow all three steps:

1. `composer require vendor/plugin-name`
2. `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=nativephp-plugins-provider` — publishes the app's `NativeServiceProvider`
   (needed once, before the first plugin registration; harmless to re-run)
3. `php artisan native:plugin:register vendor/plugin-name` — adds it to the `NativeServiceProvider`
4. `php artisan native:plugin:list` — verify it shows as registered

Then tell the user to rebuild with `php artisan native:run` (native code only compiles in at build time — do not
run this yourself). If `native:run` warns "The following plugins are installed but not registered", go back to
step 3.

### Database Seeding — Always via Migrations

On-device there is no `db:seed` — NativePHP runs **migrations** on app start (once each, tracked, versioned).
Whenever asked to seed the database, use the migration trick: create a dedicated migration
(`php artisan make:migration seed_app_settings`) and put the inserts in `up()`. If a Seeder class helps organize
the data, still create it — but invoke it **from the migration's `up()`** (e.g. `(new CategorySeeder)->run()`),
never rely on `db:seed` being run. Seed migrations must be safe for both fresh installs and updates of existing
user databases.

### Build Commands — Tell the User, Never Run

**CRITICAL: Never execute any of these commands yourself. Always instruct the user to run them manually in their
terminal.**

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `php artisan native:run ios` | Compile and run on iOS simulator/device |
| `php artisan native:run android` | Compile and run on Android emulator/device |
| `php artisan native:run ios --watch` | Build, deploy, then start hot reload — all in one |
| `php artisan native:watch` | Hot reload (watch for file changes) |
| `php artisan native:open` | Open project in Xcode or Android Studio |
| `php artisan native:install` | Install/upgrade the native shell |

Notes:
- The `./native` shortcut wraps the `native:` namespace (`./native run`, `./native watch`).
- The Vite dev server is **opt-in** in v4: add `--vite` to `native:run`/`native:watch` only when the app actually
  uses JS/CSS HMR. Native UI screens hot-reload without Vite.
- `npm run build -- --mode=ios|android` is only needed for apps with web-view assets — not for native UI screens.

**Always ask which platform before giving any build or run command.** If the user hasn't specified iOS or Android,
ask: "Which platform do you want to build/test on — iOS or Android?" Never assume a platform.

When the platform is confirmed, give the relevant command(s) above and tell the user to run it in their terminal.
Do not run it yourself.
